            <h4>Lesson Overview:</h4>

            <p>Writing code is a series of instructions, organized in a structure. Students will follow the instructions in the Treehouse Club - JavaScript videos and in their Workspaces to edit the structure and style of their web page. (Workspaces is the local development environment built into the Treehouse site. Please see more information about Workspaces in the 'Background and Information' section.) At the end of the lesson, students should be able to publish their first web page on a (non sharable) web browser using Workspaces.</p>

            <p>To accomplish this they are going to use three special programming languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  HTML will build the structure of the web page, CSS will style the web page, and JavaScript will give the page functionality.  Specifically, the JavaScript will make the buttons play a sounds when you click on them with a mouse or trackpad.  Students will be given everything necessary to publish this web application in the Workspace, the student’s job it to edit the content in the template.</p>

            <h4>Background and Information:</h4>
            
            <p>JavaScript is an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. CSS is a style-sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language, like HTML. Along with the HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create functionally engaging web pages and user interaction for web applications.</p> 

            <p>By using the Treehouse's coding tool, called Workspaces, to edit their HTML code, the web app students create will never be released on the Internet. Students will only be able to view their code in the browser while Workspaces is open; once Workspaces is closed, the content becomes unavailable. Once the coding window is closed, the webpage will not exist on the Internet.</p>

        <h4>Materials:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Computer or iPad - 1 per student</li>

        <h4>Lesson Plan: Estimated time  ~ 60 minutes</h4>
        <article>
            <h5>1. Connection to prior-knowledge: 3-5 minutes</h5>
            <p>Ask the students about what happens when you push a button on a web page? What happens when you submit a form? What happens when you select something from a drop-down menu? How does this work? What makes the web page do what your mouse is telling it to do? Example responses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A web page receives your clicks and then performs some action to make them work. </li>
                    <li>JavaScript makes buttons on a web page work.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes when you click a button it can take you to another web page. </li> 
                    <li>Sometimes when you submit a form it gives you a completion page or an alert.</li>
                </ul>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>2. Introduction to project: 5 minutes</h5>
            <p>Let the students know they are going to be making a web application that has three buttons. When you click on the buttons, the button will play a sound. Students will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make their web application look good and work properly.</p>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>3. Code Requirements: 5 minutes</h5>
            <p>HTML should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Four pictures - of any subject</li>
                <li>Three sounds - of any subject</li>
            </ul>
            <p>CSS should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Background color</li>
                <li>Image and button styling</li>
            </ul>
              <p>JavaScript should make the buttons play a sound.</p>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>4. Coding exercise: 40 minutes</h5>
            <p>Opening computers, log on to Treehouse, and locate the Treehouse Club - JavaScript lesson in the library.</p>
            <p>Project or individually watch the first video for <em>Car Sounds</em>.</p>
            <p>Have students open up the Workspace by clicking the button that says ‘Launch Workspace’ next to the video.</p>
            <p>Students edit the pre-written code in the Workspace. Remind students to save their work and preview it in the browser frequently during the editing process.</p> 
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>5. Share out: 10 minutes</h5>
            <p>Incentivize completion by scheduling time at the end of class for students to share what they have made with the class.</p>
            <p>This can be achieved in a number of ways. A few suggestions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project projects at the front of the class.</li>
                <li>Gallery walk, where students leave their computers open and walk around the room.</li>
                <li>Table or pair share, allowing students to talk about what they did in more depth with a smaller number of students.</li>
            </ul>
